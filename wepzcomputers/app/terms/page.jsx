                <p>
                  Any verbal quote given by WepZ Computers is given as a guide
                  based on the limited information provided by a customer. A
                  verbal quote is intended to give the customer an estimate on
                  the price and not an assurance that the product or service
                  will be sold at that price. Any written quote will be provided
                  by WepZ Computers at that price. All written quotes are valid
                  for only 7 days. Once work commences, after a technician has
                  evaluated the system, should it appear that the cost to repair
                  is more than quoted, no work will commence without explicit
                  client approval

                  cabinet or component breakage due to misuse. Damage caused by
                  power surges or spikes, including and not limited to, mains
                  power and telecommunications connections, or to other
                  unspecified sources, voltage fluctuation, amperage
                  fluctuation, rust, or corrosion, are not covered under
                  warranty. Warranties do not cover loss or damage due to

                  electrical storms or any other act of God or any war-related
                  events. The warranty on any hardware will be voided if any
                  sticker placed on the warrant-able equipment is removed,
                  broken or tampered with. This warranty does not cover failure
                  of equipment due to the system not being serviced adequately,
                  or failure from “fair wear and tear”. This warranty does not
                  cover repairs for the replacement of parts due to
                  incompatibility. The warranty holder will be liable to pay for
                  these repairs.

                  additional 5% penalty will be added for each week of
                  delinquency or the maximum permitted by law. In case
                  collection proves necessary, the client agrees to pay all fees
                  incurred by that process.
