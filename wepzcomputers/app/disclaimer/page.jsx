                  Disclaimer Certain products/services and links to
                  products/services are affiliate links, and I may earn a
                  commission for any purchases that you make. Occasionally, I am
                  compensated to give my honest opinion on products and/or
                  services. This will not incur additional cost to you. I
                  mention these products and services to you because I believe
                  in them and want to help you improve your life. I only
                  recommend products or services that I feel deliver value to
                  you. With full disclosure, of course, Wepz Computers is a
                  for-profit business, which means I do earn an income with this
                  website. To make it easy on both of us, you should assume that
                  any links leading you to products or services are affiliate
                  links and that I will receive a commission from your purchase.
                  All efforts are made to ensure that affiliate links are
                  disclosed in accordance with the FTC. We are also affiliated
                  with Amazon and other e-commerce websites. We make some
                  revenue when you buy after clicking our links (at no extra
                  cost to you). But our views are not biased just because we
                  make affiliate money. We do our best effort to provide you the
                  authentic information. Let me know if you have any questions.
